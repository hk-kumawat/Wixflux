## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict house prices using a Linear Regression model. By leveraging historical data on various features, we aim to develop a model that can accurately estimate housing prices.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn


You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "USA_Housing.csv" file, which contains data on various housing features and prices.

## Data Processing
The data processing steps include:
1. Load Data: Read the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Visualize Data: Use pair plots and distribution plots to understand the data distribution and relationships.
3. Handle Non-Numeric Data: Identify and drop non-numeric columns.
4. Correlation Heatmap: Generate a heatmap to visualize the correlation between features.

## Model
The model used in this project is a Linear Regression model, implemented using scikit-learn.


## Training
The training process involves the following steps:
1. Split Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets (70% training, 30% testing).
2. Train Model: Fit the Linear Regression model on the training data.
3. Evaluate Model: Use the testing set to evaluate the model's performance.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

The model achieved the following results:
- MAE: 82,288
- MSE: 10,460,958,907
- RMSE: 102,279
- R²: 0.918

## Output
The following visualizations are generated to better understand the model's performance:
