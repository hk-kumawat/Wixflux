# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow. The model is trained and tested on the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a model capable of recognizing handwritten digits with high accuracy. This model can be used in various applications such as digitizing handwritten notes, automatic number plate recognition, and more.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```


## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is used for training and evaluating the model. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image of a digit.
